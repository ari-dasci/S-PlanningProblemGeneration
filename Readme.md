# Planning Problem Generation with Graph Neural Networks

This project provides a method for the automatic generation of PDDL planning problems, using Graph Neural 
Networks and Reinforcement Learning.

### Acknowledgments

We want to thank the authors of the paper "Learning General Optimal Policies with Graph Neural Networks: Expressive Power, Transparency, and Limits", especially Dr. Simon St√•hlberg, for their help with the implementation of the ACR-GNN used in this project.

We also want to thank Antonio Manjavacas for his advice on the most suitable RL algoritm for our problem.
