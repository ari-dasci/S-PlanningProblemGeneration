;; Adapted from: https://github.com/AI-Planning/pddl-generators/tree/main/miconic
;; We modify the miconic domain using predicates (at ?p - passenger ?f - floor) instead of
;; (origin ?person - passenger ?floor - floor), (destination ?person - passenger ?floor - floor) and (served ?person - passenger)
;; Additionally, we introduce a predicate (lift_empty) so that the lift can only carry one passenger at the same time, in order 
;; to increase the difficulty of the domain
